# Sentiment_Analysis

Analytical sentiment is a subdomain of opinion mining that focuses on the extraction from structured, semi-structured or unstructured textual data of people's feelings and opinions towards a given theme. In this report we try to concentrate on the IMDB film review database for our sentiment analysis. We study the feel-good expression to categorize the polarity of the movie review on positive and negative to carry out the extraction and ranking of features, using these characteristics to train our multi-label classification to classify the movie review into its correct label. Because of the absence of strong grammatical structures, an organized approach was used in film reviews that follow informal language. Furthermore, the best appropriate classifier for our problem domain has been determined by a comparison analysis of different classificational methodologies. We conclude that our proposed sentiment categorization approach complements the existing web-based film rating systems and will be the basis of future study in this area. The best precision for our approach is around 80 percent using classification algorithms.
